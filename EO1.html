            <h3>My Narrative Essay: Fractured Dreams Heal a Broken Mind</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">
“Stop wearing your wishbone where your backbone ought to be.” (Elizabeth Gilbert). This quote has become words I have to remind myself of every morning as I roll out of bed, every class as I go to sit down in the chair, and every night as I go to sleep. However, a while ago, I did not live by these words, and today it seems I would give anything I have to go back to that time.
The Covid lockdown was a while ago; specifically, it was a summer going into my freshman year. With not much else to do, I found myself often playing baseball with my team of close friends. We practiced 2 to 3 hours every day, except Sunday. Most Sundays, some friends and I would go put in our own work. Our coach always told us, “Everyone here is good. It’s on you to be great.” This phrase became seared into my brain; it is what I credit my success in life to. However, it is the same words that also became the root of my problems. At the beginning of my freshman year, I was quite impressionable. This led me to take those words from my coach with perhaps a bit more weight than I should have. I was already a young, overwhelmed kid, and I began to see everyone as competition, especially during baseball practice after school. Every single day, I gave it my all in preparation for the upcoming season. Every single day, I got better—until I didn’t. I woke up one morning and immediately knew something was wrong.
To this day, I’ve never experienced such abrupt, excruciating pain as I did that morning. I woke up to a sharp, stabbing pain shooting down my back, like someone had taken a red-hot poker and shoved it right into my spine. I tried to move and couldn’t. Every time I shifted, it felt like my lower back was tearing apart, like my muscles were locked in a vise. I could barely breathe without sending jolts of pain down my legs, and any hope of standing up seemed impossible. My whole body felt like it was working against me, the pressure in my lower back building to something I couldn’t ignore. I tried to roll to my side, but a sudden, fierce pain made me cry out. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I lay there, helpless, calling for my mom. My mom, seeing how much pain I was in, immediately booked a doctor’s appointment for that day. The doctor later informed me that my L5-S1 spinal disc was protruding from my spine, pressing into my spinal cord and causing me this otherworldly pain. The next words out of my doctor’s mouth were, “No more baseball.” These words cut so deep that they almost distracted me from my back pain for a second. It was as if I lost control of my consciousness; I could feel my coach’s words and the doctor’s orders battling it out inside my brain, as if they were in their own miniature Colosseum. They pulled, tugged, and fought until eventually they compromised: I could carry out my wish of continuing to play baseball by staying on the team and limiting my activity. So that’s exactly what I did—until my sophomore year.
My sophomore year was so bad that the doctors refused to clear to me to play. Instead, I was sent to a spine specialist who essentially threw medication at me and told me to get out. At first, I was ecstatic to be offered an escape from my chronic pain, but I soon found out everything comes with a catch. The medication was a neurological depressant; its purpose was to slow the firing in my neurons to ease some of the pain, but in order to do this, it had to slow down all my neurons. I could write and revise a million times and still be nowhere close to conveying a fraction of the insanity I was experiencing. The medication altered my literal brain chemistry so that I became someone else—someone I didn’t recognize. What was once an outgoing, social boy became nothing more than a shell of himself. But this wasn’t the worst of it. The mood swings would come most nights. I remember sitting on the floor of my room with the back of my head pressed firmly into the chilled metal frame of my bed. Within this head was a cacophony of slithering thoughts that wrestled with one another, desperately grappling in hopes of reaching any part of my brain that they could get their tentacles on. There was no method to this madness of thought; it was simply survival of the fittest: me versus parasitic thoughts in my head. This would go on for no more than 30 minutes until some chemical switch would flip inside my brain, and suddenly the tentacles that were once plaguing my brain turned into the fuzzy arms of a teddy bear hand-crafted from silk. The arms embraced my brain so that every square inch felt as if it were cozied up in a blanket with a cup of hot chocolate on a cold snowy day. It was almost as if my brain knew I had been sad because shortly after it comforted me with embracing arms, the arms grew fingers and began tickling me. At first, it was funny and an escape from the previous feelings. However, the tickling wouldn’t stop. I laughed and laughed until my laughter turned to tears and my stomach ached from the constant convolution. These episodes were so disturbing that it only took my mom seeing it once to have her throw away the medication, and slowly I grew back into that shell.
My pain became worse, and playing baseball became less enjoyable. It got to the point where I had to take 800 mg of Advil just to make it through practice, but I didn’t care because all I wished for was to be able to play. Eventually, the end of my senior season came, and as anyone would do, I reminisced about my high school baseball career. However, I didn’t find fun memories that I wished I could relive. I found a sense of relief that it was done. I had spent so much of my life on baseball that it had become my backbone. It was something that began to define who I was as a person, which is why I got a sense of relief that it was over. Without baseball defining me anymore, I felt a sense of freedom; like a little kid dressing up a Barbie doll, I could be whatever I wanted to be now. While playing baseball, I lost sight of the things that made me who I was. I pushed myself through pain, damaging my body beyond repair because my wishbone dream was where my backbone was supposed to be. This realization allowed me to begin to regrow my backbone and branch out into other important aspects of my life. I traded my physical backbone for a wishbone dream, and I will have to live with the physical consequences of that for the rest of my life. However, I will also continue to grow my metaphorical backbone for the rest of my life, as it extends out to the people, places, and things that I love, and I think a lifetime of those experiences is worth far more than an L5-S1 disc.

            <h3>Fresh Voices Excerpt: The Small Town Complex</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">I was sixteen years old when I started to outgrow the city limits I had stayed so loyal to my whole life prior. I was granted the greatest luxury known to a teenager - my first car. Certified with my California driver's license, I was ready to hit the road and see the world. Little did I know that there was so much to be seen outside the seven-mile safety net I grew up in. I was also sixteen years old when I began to resent the small-town culture that Auburn had curated. I wanted to embrace my teenage rebellion, and there were eyes (literally) on every street corner that wanted to restrain it. The football coach doubled as the local youth group leader who just wanted to know, for our well being, what my friends and I were doing behind the bleachers at the game last Friday night. My neighbor wanted to "check in" with my mom about how many people I was allowed to have over when she was out of town. Surely not the whole high school? Right? My car became my one-way ticket to new friends, new places, and new small towns - ones that felt a lot more fun to visit than to live in.

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">The rhetorical situation composed of the author, audience, purpose, and context guides writers on how they will approach their work in terms of topic, genre, content, and style. In ENGL 134, I put these principles to test through the different genres which include literacy narrative and public rhetoric/argument. For this analysis, I have reflected on two sequences: Literacy Narrative and Public Rhetoric/Argument, by using my essays and Fresh Voices excerpts as examples. This reflection reveals how rhetorical situations influence writing and how the analysis of published works informed my own approach.
The literacy narrative genre is all about storytelling and reflection, therefore it relies heavily on vivid personal experiences and a relatable voice to engage an audience. My essay, “Fractured Dreams Heal a Broken Mind,” captures my journey of navigating chronic pain and personal growth through the lens of my experiences with baseball. I paired this with the Fresh Voices essay”Small Town Complex.” Both pieces focus on transformation and self-discovery but approach these themes differently, shaped by their rhetorical situations. Within my essay, I wrote to the audience of peers and a professor, trying to appeal to the readers with similar challenges and emotional honesty. For example, I described how my injury affected me both physically and emotionally. “My pain became worse, and playing baseball became less enjoyable. It got to the point where I had to take 800 mg of Advil just to make it through practice, but I didn't care because all I wished for was to be able to play” (Lenz 3). This detail emphasizes the lengths I went to for my passion, showcasing vulnerability and perseverance. Similarly, the Fresh Voices essay uses relatable imagery to engage readers, describing the freedom of driving. “My car became my one-way ticket to new friends, new places, and new small towns—ones that felt a lot more fun to visit than to live in” (Conway 40). While both of the narratives have balanced introspection with the vivid description that is supposed to establish a connection with their audience, the rhetorical situation influenced the scope and tone of the essays. Mine focused on internal transformation and resilience, while the Fresh Voices dealt with experiences that were mostly about externals and independence. These differences show that the rhetorical situations do shape content and focus in literacy narratives.
Reading the Fresh Voices essay furthered my approach to telling the story, especially in using sensory details to draw readers into my experience. The way this author threaded the relatable imagery with personal growth inspired me to refine my descriptions to make sure they were emotionally connecting with my audience. Additionally, her conversational tone influenced how I refined my voice to strike a balance between authenticity and relatability.

            <h3>My Argumentative Essay:Body Positivity: Paving the Road to a Better Future, or Destroying it? </h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">In the fictional movie WALL-E there is a world in which humans have become so overweight that they no longer can walk. They must rely on machines and technology to carry out what once were considered simple tasks. Unfortunately this fictional concept is looking like more of a possible reality with the way obesity rates are trending around the world right now with many blaming the body positivity movement. The body positivity movement promotes self-love and acceptance of diverse body types and has become a cultural force in recent years. However, as obesity rates in the United States continue to rise, critics argue that this movement may be increasing obesity by normalizing unhealthy weights and habits. In contrast, supporters argue that body positivity improves mental health, combats stigma, and does not directly discourage healthy behaviors. While the movement may contribute to a complacent attitude toward weight management, the rising rates of obesity is more closely tied to systemic issues like food environments, socioeconomic disparities, and lack of public health education. Addressing obesity requires focusing on these root causes rather than blaming a social movement that has for the most part been a response to weight discrimination.
Obesity rates in the United States have reached alarming levels, creating significant issues in public health. Recent data indicates that 37.7% of adults and 17% of children in the United States have obesity, with severe obesity rates continuing to rise (Flegal et. al 2285). These trends carry serious implications for individual health and the healthcare system, as obesity is a major risk factor for conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers (Zia et. al 54). Rising obesity rates have also been linked to a leveling-off of cardiovascular mortality declines, a troubling trend after decades of progress (Zia et. al 54). The economic burden of obesity is another equally important yet less discussed issue, with diabetes-related healthcare costs projected to reach $514 billion by 2025 (Zia et. al 55). These expenses create a socioeconomic barrier that puts people who can not afford these health care services at greater risk. Critics of the body positivity movement argue that its emphasis on self-acceptance undermines efforts to address these pressing issues. However, attributing the obesity epidemic to a social movement oversimplifies the problem and diverts attention from its complex root causes.
Critics like Raya Muttarak Ph.D, argue that body positivity fosters the “normalization of obesity,” reducing societal pressure to address weight concerns. People who might be dissatisfied with their weight at one time would be forced to either live with that uncomfort or change their lifestyle to fix it. However, with the increasing presence of the body positivity movement critics argue that people can find comfort in peers who also are dissatisfied and this comfort allows them to adopt an even more unhealthy lifestyle.  Meanwhile, supporters like Cohen, Newton-John, and Slater emphasize the mental health benefits of body positivity and its role in promoting self-esteem, particularly among vulnerable groups. While body positivity has its limitations, the larger systemic factors driving obesity demand more urgent attention.
One of the primary criticisms of body positivity is that it normalizes obesity and discourages individuals from pursuing weight loss or other health goals. Muttarak suggests that the movement contributes to weight misperception, where individuals with obesity may view their weight as normal, leading to reduced motivation for lifestyle changes (1127). This concept aligns with the widespread belief that body positivity could inadvertently promote unhealthy behaviors. Commentators like McWhorter suggest that emphasizing body acceptance sends the message that health concerns associated with obesity are unimportant, potentially reducing societal emphasis on addressing these risks.
However, evidence challenges these claims. Research by Rupp and McCoy demonstrates that individuals engaged in body positivity content often report higher levels of physical activity, a critical component of healthy living (555). Furthermore, body positivity aims to reduce stigma, not to glorify unhealthy behaviors. The core mission of the movement is to create an environment where individuals can appreciate their bodies without succumbing to societal pressures that often lead to disordered eating and other harmful practices. Critics who equate body acceptance with promoting obesity fail to recognize this distinction and overlook the mental health benefits that body positivity provides.
The roots of obesity lie far deeper than societal attitudes toward body image. Systemic factors such as food deserts, aggressive marketing of unhealthy foods, and limited access to healthcare disproportionately affect low-income and minority communities, driving the obesity epidemic (Zia et. al 54). These factors create environments where unhealthy choices are often the most accessible and affordable options. For example, many urban and rural areas lack grocery stores with fresh produce, leaving residents to rely on fast food or processed snacks high in calories and low in nutritional value. Additionally, food advertising often targets children and vulnerable populations, normalizing the consumption of sugary beverages and high-fat foods.
Socioeconomic disparities only make these problems worse. Low-income individuals often face barriers when it comes to receiving healthcare related to these issues, gym memberships, or dietary counseling, making it even more difficult to adopt healthier lifestyles. Moreover, long work hours and financial stress leave little time or energy for physical activity or meal preparation. These systemic issues highlight the need for policy-level interventions, including better food labeling, subsidies for healthier options, and increased funding for public fitness programs. Blaming the body positivity movement takes the blame away from these systemic issues and will lead to a lack of resolutions.
Despite criticisms, the body positivity movement offers meaningful benefits, particularly in promoting mental health and reducing weight stigma. Body dissatisfaction is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including depression, low self-esteem, and unhealthy dieting behaviors (Alleva and Tylka 1527). By encouraging individuals to appreciate their bodies regardless of size, the movement promotes resilience against societal pressures that prioritize the appearance of a body even at the expense of well-being. This perspective is particularly important for groups who are disproportionately affected by weight stigma, such as women and people of color, who often face the most forms of discrimination.
Research by Rupp and McCoy who have both received doctoral degrees from respected universities, highlights the positive impact of body positivity on mental health. Their study found that participants engaged in body positivity content reported greater body appreciation, a critical factor in fostering self-esteem and overall well-being (556). Additionally, body positivity content on social media often emphasizes body functionality rather than appearance, encouraging individuals to focus on what their bodies can do rather than how they look. This shift in perspective aligns with the principles of Health at Every Size (HAES), a movement that emphasizes healthy behaviors over weight loss and has been shown to improve both physical and mental health outcomes.
While the body positivity movement provides important benefits, it is not without its limitations. Some individuals may misinterpret its messages as an endorsement of unhealthy lifestyles, leading to personal acceptance of an unhealthy lifestyle. For example, critics argue that slogans like “All bodies are good bodies” could be understood to mean that health risks associated with obesity are negligible. These misinterpretations highlight the need for clearer messaging within the movement, emphasizing that while self acceptance is important, so is health. Public health campaigns can play a crucial role in addressing these concerns. By integrating the beneficial concepts of body positivity with evidence-based health interventions, campaigns can promote both physical and mental well-being. For instance, emphasizing the importance of  things like balanced nutrition, regular exercise, and preventive care messages of self-acceptance can simultaneously be good for both individual empowerment and public health goals. Educational programs that teach children about healthy habits while celebrating body diversity could also help combat obesity without adding a stigma.
Blaming the body positivity movement for rising obesity rates oversimplifies a complex issue and risks continuing the use of harmful stereotypes. A more effective approach involves addressing the systemic issues that cause obesity while incorporating the positive aspects of body positivity into public health strategies. For example, policies that increase access to affordable, nutritious foods and create safe spaces for physical activity can empower individuals to make healthier choices without resorting to shame or blame. Furthermore, reducing weight stigma is essential for encouraging individuals to seek medical care and adopt healthier behaviors. Research shows that stigma often leads to avoidance of healthcare settings, making health disparities worse (Rupp and McCoy 553). By creating a culture of acceptance and support, public health initiatives can foster an environment where individuals feel empowered to prioritize their health.
The body positivity movement is not the primary cause of the obesity epidemic. While it may inadvertently influence societal attitudes toward weight, its core mission of promoting self-acceptance and reducing stigma addresses critical mental health concerns. The rise in obesity in reality is attributed to systemic factors like food environments, socioeconomic disparities, and insufficient public health policies. Rather than scapegoating a social movement, efforts to combat obesity should focus on addressing these structural issues and fostering environments that support healthier lifestyles for all. By integrating the principles of body positivity with evidence-based public health education, society can promote both physical and mental well-being, paving the way for a healthier future.

            <h3>Fresh Voices Excerpt: Amazon: A Double-Edged Sword for Small Businesses</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">One of the only benefits of Amazon is that even amateur entrepreneurs can sell on its marketplace. In their article, former federal prosecutor and law firm owner Eric Chaffin and prior assistant district attorney and current plaintiff attorney Steven Cohn state, "Amazon and other internet retailers have created new opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs around the world to sell products on an easily accessible platform. Amazon is not doing anything special; other internet retailers have been doing this for years. Making their site seller-friendly is nothing unique, as eBay has been doing it for over a decade before Amazon.
Essentially, Amazon is doing the bare minimum to stay competitive. This is not to look out for their sellers, and it shows: that with the support of Walmart's platform, sellers were able to bring in $555 billion, but Amazon, with their supposed dominance, only managed $470 billion ("Amazon's Sales by..; Ozbun). Despite Amazon giving small businesses easy access to the open market, Amazon still shad-owbans small retailers, hindering their success. Thus, smaller retailers should not (solely rely on Amazon for their primary income, Backing up this claim, Weigel has shown two success stories from an amateur and a small business owner. Firstly, a woman named Blake decided to sell her textbooks on Amazon when school ended and no longer had a use for them, but soon, she started reselling everything she could on the site. Blake continued this throughout her life (Weigel). In essence, Amazon was a subsidiary endeavor for Blake, a way for her to generate supplementary income while still having a primary source of income. Her livelihood was not based on this income, and her stakes were low. Blake does not have high stakes in Amazon, so if she fails, there are low consequences. Eduardo, a man running a small shoe store chain with his family, is skeptical of Amazon and does not believe in online shopping. After much persuasion, he started selling the shoes that no one would buy. Since these shoes are hard to get, they sometimes sell for four to five times more than they would in the store (Weigel). Eduardo uses Amazon as a supplement to his existing brick-and-mortar business. Amazon can help small business owners in a multitude of different ways, but relying on just Amazon and nothing else can be a problem.

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">Public rhetoric allows the writer to construct an argument with their audience in mind, supported with evidence and ideas of the opposing view. My essay, "Body Positivity: Paving the Road to a Better Future, or Destroying It?" presents the body positivity movement from both sides of the argument and balances its positive effect against possible dangers. I paired this with a Fresh Voices essay about Amazon's practices that makes use of similar rhetorical moves in exploring a pressing issue. In my essay, I acknowledged the rhetorical situation of having an audience that may be divided. In appealing to the readers, I brought forward different sides of the argument. For instance, I said, "emphasizing body acceptance sends the message that health concerns associated with obesity are unimportant, potentially reducing societal emphasis on addressing these risks. However, evidence challenges these claims" (Lenz 3). This recognition of potential downsides agrees with what the audience expects in regard to balance and fairness within public rhetoric. Similarly, the Fresh Voices essay considers the benefits of the platform, stating: "Amazon and other internet retailers have created new opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs around the world to sell products on easily accessible platform" (Yosian 131). While both essays depend on balanced arguments and logical reasoning to effectively reach their audience, the rhetorical situation can control how evidence is presented. My essay uses expert opinions and health statistics to gain credibility while addressing concerns about body positivity, whereas the Fresh Voices piece uses financial data in order to critique Amazon's practices. With "Walmart's platform, sellers were able to bring in $555 billion, but Amazon, with their supposed dominance, was only able to manage $470 billion" (Yosian 131). These rhetorical choices reflect what an analytical audience would expect.. Both essays attended to the rhetorical situation in providing substance that would establish credibility and hold the attention of the readers. Studying the Fresh Voices argumentative essay influenced my approach to structuring my essay. The author’s integration of quantitative data and counterarguments demonstrated the importance of acknowledging multiple perspectives. This strategy inspired me to strengthen my essay by addressing the positive and negative aspects of body positivity, ensuring that my argument appealed to not just one audience but all.</div>
