        <h2 class="section-title">Consider This Questions</h2>
        <div class="text-placeholder"> What is the thesis or main argument of the essay? How does the writer support this argument? 
In the essay “Terraforming Mars for Human Habitation”, Ethan Dickson says that terraforming Mars is a viable and possible next step for the survival of humanity due to environmental adversity. The author supports this claim by describing scientific processes through which Mars could be made habitable, including creating greenhouse gases, orbital mirrors, and artificial magnetic fields. These ideas are further supported by citations of scientific research, and historical examples of exploration and innovation.
</div>
        <div class="text-placeholder">Who is the intended audience, and how does the writer appeal to this audience?
This essay targets readers interested in science, policymakers, and visionaries concerned with aspects of sustainability and space exploration. The author reaches out to these groups through the clarity and simplicity in using scientific terminology. These theoretical concepts, paired with concrete solutions, easily keeps the reader engaged.
</div>
        <div class="text-placeholder"> What are some rhetorical strategies the writer uses to strengthen the argument? 
Some of the rhetorical strategies the author has used include:
Logos (Logical Appeals): The use of scientific concepts, historical precedents like the exploration of the moon, and the presentation of data on the possibility of terraforming Mars establishes a logical framework for this.
Pathos (Emotional Appeals): The essay identifies with the concern of all for the deteriorating environment of Earth and presents Mars as a hope for humanity's future. 
 Ethos: Referring to experts and established research in planetary science enhances the writer's credibility and trustworthiness.
</div>
        <div class="text-placeholder"> How is the essay organized? Is the structure effective for the argument?
The essay is organized with logical structure. From an engaging introduction about Earth's ecological issues, the text moves to the possibility of terraforming Mars, and finally, to the implications for humanity. Each section flows smoothly into the next, creating a tight and persuasive argument. This structure is fitting for a scientifically literate audience, providing clarity and clearly providing understanding of complex ideas.
</div>
        <div class="text-placeholder">What does the essay miss?  
The essay would benefit most from addressing some counterarguments. The author could play Devil's Advocate by mentioning different opinions, such as possible ethical dilemmas or dangers involved with terraforming, might lend more depth and believability to the argument itself.
Strengthening the conclusion: A conclusion that provides action steps or poses thought-provoking questions would leave a lasting impression on the audience.

        <h2 class="section-title">Reflection on ENGL 145 Preparation</h2>
        <div class="text-placeholder">My experience in ENGL 134 has equipped me with the foundational skills necessary for the analytical and argumentative writing expected in ENGL 145/147. I have learned to deconstruct texts by analyzing their structure, arguments, and rhetorical strategies, a skill that will be relied upon when engaging with more complex texts and evaluating evidence and logic in ENGL 145/147. The emphasis on crafting well-reasoned, evidence-based arguments in ENGL 134 has prepared me to construct positions on important issues. However, I look forward to refining my reasoning further at the next level. Additionally, I have gained an awareness of tone, style, and structure in relation to audience and purpose, which will be crucial for persuasive communication targeting a broader and more diverse audience in ENGL 145/147. The course also provided a solid foundation in research-based writing. This taught me how to properly integrate credible sources and enabled me to make evidence-based arguments and contribute to academic conversations. Most importantly, ENGL 134 has taught me to approach writing as a dynamic process involving drafting, revising, and incorporating feedback, which will allow me to tackle more challenging assignments in ENGL 145/147 with confidence. Overall, ENGL 134 has set the stage for my success in ENGL 145/147, where I hope to continue building my skills in constructing multi-layered arguments and critically reading diverse texts.</div>
