        <div class="image-text-container">
            <img src="IMG_1070.jpg" alt="Burkean Parlor Activity">
            <div class="text-placeholder">In this class, one of the most influential activities had to do with the discussion of food insecurity from many different sources: the so-called Burkean Parlor. The metaphor of authors joining a conversation in the "parlor" is what helped me construct My argumentative essay.
Throughout the exercise, I examined selections from three texts of unique perspectives and collaborated with a group to discuss shared understandings and debates. This activity helped me determine some main arguments in my essay because this forced me to consider body positivity within a larger scope of the cultural movement. For instance, one discussed the failures of the movement as causing complacency in individuals; another discussed the beneficial impacts the movement has had for individuals in terms of mental health. Doing this activity crystallized, for me, the balance I had to create within my essay because I realized that showing both sides would strengthen my argument. The collaborative nature of the activity also exposed me to new sources of evidence, such as studies on the economic impact of obesity and its systemic causes, which became central to my essay.

        <div class="image-text-container">
            <img src="IMG_0887.jpg" alt="Brainstorm Activity">
            <div class="text-placeholder"> The brainstorming activity for my literacy narrative, really helped me to find the core themes of my story. This activity required me to visually map out key moments, emotions, and reflections related to my personal experience with chronic pain and its impact on my identity.
In doing so, I created mini stories that wove together three ideas that initially seemed separate: my physical struggle with pain, my relationship with baseball, and my eventual emotional growth. This process let me not only discover the central metaphor of the wishbone versus the backbone but also clarify the emotional relevance of my story. Initially I found it difficult to balance the telling of a story descriptively, but the brainstorming activity showed me that such seemingly separate things could be related. For example, the session of brainstorming helped me with the transition from considering baseball as my defining identity to its limitations being recognized; this became a key turning point in my essay.

        <h2 class="section-title">Peer Review</h2>
        <div class="image-text-container">
            <img src="IMG_0992.jpg" alt="Peer Review Activity">
            <div class="text-placeholder">The peer review workshop was also crucial during the profile sequence to refine the structure and focus of "The Way of the Wind." In this workshop, my peers commented on the rough draft of the essay, paying attention to clarity, organization, and audience engagement. One of the most helpful insights was that, while my introduction was very vivid, it did not relate to the mission of the Wind Power Club. This remark served as a reason for me to rewrite the opening paragraph so that it would directly relate to the purpose of the essay. The workshop also revealed points that required further revision, such as explaining what exactly the technical part of the wind turbines is. Initially, I had included a quote from my interview with Anshul Deshmukh but did not properly clarify terms like “buck-boost converter” for a general audience. Based on my peers’ feedback, I revised the section to include a more understandable explanation, improving the essay’s readability.This collaborative process showed me how to write not for myself but for the readers, which allowed me to refine my ideas and better anticipate audience needs.</div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Impact of the Writing Process on Final Essays</h2>
        <div class="text-placeholder">Each of these activities exemplifies how the writing process fosters discovery, development, and clarification. The Burkean Parlor discussion taught me to consider my argumentative essay as part of a greater conversation that informed and furthered my perspective and evidence. The narrative brainstorming activity allowed me to find deeper connections within my personal story, improving its emotional connection with myself and readers. Finally, the peer review workshop improved my clarity and audience awareness, which made huge improvements in the organization and readability of my profile essay. By engaging with peers and utilizing structured exercises, I developed a clearer understanding of my own voice and purpose as a writer.</div>
