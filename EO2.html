        <h2 class="section-title">Literacy Narrative</h2>
        <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Original Paragraph</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">My sophomore year was so bad the doctors refused to clear me to play, instead sending me to a spine specialist who essentially threw medication at me and told me to get out. At first, I was ecstatic to be offered an escape from my chronic pain, but I soon found out everything comes with a catch. The medication was a neurological depressant; it was supposed to slow the firing in my neurons to ease some of the pain, but to do this, it needed to slow down all my neurons. I could write and revise a million times and still be nowhere close to conveying a fraction of the insanity I was experiencing. The medication altered my literal brain chemistry so that I became someone else, someone foreign to myself. What was once an outgoing, social boy became nothing more than a shell of his former self.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Revised Paragraph</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">My sophomore year really brought me to a breaking point when doctors wouldn't clear me to play baseball. They sent me to a spine specialist who had one real quick solution: prescribe some neurological depressants without explanation. My initial reaction was pure relief at promises of diminished pain, but for me, this optimism had a brief shelf life. The pain medication numbed more than it healed. It slows neurons to the degree that my brain and character appeared alien. This outgoing person became an introvert of the highest degree, unreachable to everything in life I once loved. No words could describe the disorientation and anguish of living in a mind and body that no longer resembled my own.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Changes Made</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">Improved Clarity: removed ambiguous and unneeded phrases such as "essentially threw medication at me and told me to get out," and used explicit and professional expressions.
Conciseness: combined some of the sentences to eliminate unnecessary redundancy or over-explanation.
Emotional Appeal: The emotional impact here has been enhanced because the focus is put on the internal transformation due to the medicine, rather than its purpose.

        <h2 class="section-title">Argumentative Essay</h2>
        <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Original Paragraph</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">Critics like Raya Muttarak Ph.D, argue that body positivity fosters the "normalization of obesity," reducing societal pressure to address weight concerns. People who might be dissatisfied with their weight at one time would be forced to either live with that uncomfort or change their lifestyle to fix it. However, with the increasing presence of the body positivity movement, critics argue that people can find comfort in peers who also are dissatisfied, and this comfort allows them to adopt an even more unhealthy lifestyle.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Revised Paragraph</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">Critics like Raya Muttarak, Ph.D., believe that body positivity leads to the "normalization of obesity," decreasing the social motivation to address weight-related health issues. They say that those individuals who previously would have felt inspired to lead healthier lifestyles may now find solace in shared dissatisfaction, perhaps leading them to be complacent about their unhealthy behaviors. While this point raises some very valid concerns, it threatens to overgeneralize the movement's wider purposes of lessening stigma and building self-esteem.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Changes Made</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">Precision: Simplified and clarified arguments without losing the original meaning, such as changing "live with that uncomfort" to "confront weight-related health concerns."
Conciseness: Provided repetitive phrases in a more tightened manner, such as the phrase "the increasing presence of the body positivity movement."
Balance: allowed for acknowledgment of an argument by critics while subtly suggesting counterpoints.

        <h2 class="section-title">Profile Essay</h2>
        <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Original Paragraph</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">I had the opportunity to interview Anshul Deshmukh, a first-year member of the Wind Power Club, to learn more about their work and experiences. He explained that the club works all year to compete in a national competition in May. Throughout the year, they design and prototype various turbine configurations, rigorously testing ways to optimize efficiency. There are many different components that go into designing a wind turbine, as Anshul described, "As the wind turbine spins, it creates electricity through a generator. We design all of the circuit boards that tell it where to go. Then, we store it in a battery and use a buck-boost converter to regulate the RPM.</div>
        </div>

            <h3>Revised Paragraph</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">During an interview with Anshul Deshmukh, a first-year member of the Wind Power Club, he let me in on some of the cool projects and ambitions the club has. This team dedicates an entire year to preparing for a national competition in May, working through designing and prototyping different configurations of turbines to maximize efficiency. Explaining the intricacies of turbine operation, Anshul said, "As the wind turbine spins, it generates electricity through a generator. We design all the circuit boards that tell it where to go. Then we store it in a battery and use a buck-boost converter to regulate the RPM." This meticulous process underlines the commitment of the club to further refinement in wind energy technology. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Changes Made</h3>
            <div class="text-placeholder">Stronger Introduction: The opening sentence is rewritten to be more engaging because it speaks directly to an interview and its purpose.
Improved Flow: Reorganized the paragraph to better integrate the quote into the narrative, avoiding abrupt transitions.
Clarity: Removed repetitive phrasing, such as “many different components that have to be considered.”
